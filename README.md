**EdTech Guess-the-Number Learning Game**

Welcome to the Guess-the-Number EdTech Game, an interactive and educational Python program designed to teach fundamental programming concepts in a fun and engaging way! This game is perfect for students and beginners learning to code.

**📝 About the Game**
The Guess-the-Number game challenges players to guess a randomly selected number between 1 and 50. It provides feedback and encourages logical reasoning, while also teaching core programming principles like loops, conditionals, and input validation.

**Key Features**
Random Number Generation: The game selects a number between 1 and 50 randomly.
Input Validation: Ensures the guess is valid and within range.
Feedback: Offers hints like "Too high" or "Too low" to help players refine their guesses.
Error Handling: Displays a custom error message for guesses outside the range of 1–50.
Replayability: Players can continue playing or exit after each game.

**🎓 Learning Objectives**
This game helps students and beginner programmers learn:

**While Loops :** Repeating tasks until a condition is met.
**Conditional Statements :** Logical branching based on user input.
**Input Validation :** Handling invalid or unexpected input.
**Randomness :** Using random numbers for interactivity.
**Error Handling :** Displaying clear messages for incorrect inputs.

**🛠️ How to Install and Run**
Clone the repository:

bash
Copier le code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/guess-the-number-game.git
cd guess-the-number-game

Run the game:

bash
Copier le code
python guess_the_number.py
Enjoy the game!

**📚 How to Play**

The computer will randomly select a number between 1 and 50.
Enter your guess in the terminal.
Follow the feedback provided:
Too high!: Your guess is greater than the selected number.
Too low!: Your guess is less than the selected number.
Correct!: Celebrate your win!
If you enter a number outside the range (1–50), the game will display:
sql
Copier le code
❌ Out of range! Please guess a number between 1 and 50.
You can type exit anytime to quit the game.

**💡 Educational Value**
This game demonstrates:

**Logical Reasoning :** Players use feedback to make better guesses.
**Range Validation :** Ensures input stays within a defined range.
**Iterative Improvement:** Allows players to continuously refine their guesses through practice.
